Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, 
primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. 
Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via 
website and mobile app.    

Airbnb does not own any of the listed 
properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each 
booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan 
Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its 
original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

The company has been criticized for enabling bait-and-switch scams, 
being involved in West Bank settlements, possibly driving up home 
rents and creating nuisances for those living near leased properties. 
The company is regulated by many jurisdictions, including the 
European Union and cities such as San Francisco and New York City.

# Problem Statement

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

## Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings (not limited to these) such as: 
* What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
* What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
